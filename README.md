# Flashbots
This script sends a transaction to a target wallet and then uses the target wallet to send USDT to a recipient address. The funding wallet covers the gas fees for both transactions. The script uses the FlashbotsBundleProvider to send the transactions in a single bundle, ensuring that they are included in the same block. The script also handles errors and logs the response from the Flashbots provider.

Note: This code is for educational purposes only. Always test on a testnet before deploying on mainnet.
Ensure you have sufficient funds in the funding wallet to cover gas fees.
Adjust the gas limit and other parameters as needed for your specific use case.
Ensure you have the correct contract address and ABI for the USDT token.
Replace placeholders with actual values before running the script.
This script assumes you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to perform these transactions.
Always follow best practices for security and privacy when handling private keys and sensitive information.
Consider using environment variables or secure vaults to store sensitive information.
Ensure you comply with all relevant laws and regulations when using Flashbots or any other service.
This script does not include error handling for transaction failures or other potential issues.
You may need to adjust the script for different Ethereum networks or tokens.
Always keep your dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
Consider adding logging and monitoring for production use.
This script is provided as-is and without warranty of any kind.
Use at your own risk.

I'm going to be uploading all of my js and py scripts using flashbots into this repository from here on out. 
Enjoy and please give feedback and comments or point me towards more resources I can learn from.
